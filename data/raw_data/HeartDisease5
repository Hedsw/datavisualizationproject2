Blood stream infections are serious infections that usually induce prolongation of hospital stay, morbidity and mortality in several countries including Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to determine bacterial and fungal profile, their drug resistance patterns, and risk factors associated with blood stream infections.
A cross sectional study design was conducted from February 23 to June 23, 2020 at Ethiopian public health. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on socio-demographic factors and clinical conditions. Blood specimens were analyzed using standard microbiological techniques. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed using Kirbyâ€“Bauer disc diffusion technique and Vitek compact 2. Simple and multiple logistic regressions were used to assess the potential risk factors.
