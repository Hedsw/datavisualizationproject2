Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration often result from the
aberrant deposition of aggregated host proteins, including
amyloid-b, a-synuclein, and prions, that can activate inflammasomes. Inflammasomes function as intracellular sensors of both
microbial pathogens and foreign as well as host-derived danger
signals. Upon activation, they induce an innate immune response
by secreting the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1b and
IL-18, and additionally by inducing pyroptosis, a lytic cell death
mode that releases additional inflammatory mediators. Microglia
are the prominent innate immune cells in the brain for inflammasome activation. However, additional CNS-resident cell types including astrocytes and neurons, as well as infiltrating myeloid cells from
the periphery, express and activate inflammasomes. In this review,
we will discuss current understanding of the role of inflammasomes in common degenerative diseases of the brain and highlight
inflammasome-targeted strategies that may potentially treat
these diseases.
