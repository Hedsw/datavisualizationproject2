A diagnosis of heart attack is based on the findings of an electrocardiogram (ECG). People admitted to hospital with suspected heart attack will be given an ECG within ten minutes of arrival. An ECG machine records the electrical signals generated by the heartbeat and a doctor can interpret this information to assess how well the heart is functioning. The treatment approach to heart attack depends on the type of heart attack the patient has had. Segment elevation myocardial infarction is the most severe form of heart attack and a patient with this condition will immediately be assessed for treatment to unblock the coronary artery.
The surgical procedures available to treat heart attack include coronary angioplasty and coronary artery bypass graft. Medications that may be administered to break down the clots include reteplase, alteplase, and streptokinase.
