Non-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a fulminant disease with an increasing incidence. The serum beta-D-glucan (BDG) assay is used as an adjunct to the diagnosis of PCP; however, the cut-off value for this assay is not well-defined, especially in the non-HIV PCP population. Therefore, we aimed to identify the assay cut-off value for this population.
In this retrospective observational study, we reviewed the medical records of all patients (≥ 18 years old) with clinical suspicion of PCP who underwent evaluation of respiratory tract specimens between December 2008 and June 2014 at Kameda Medical Center. We created a receiver operating characteristic curve and calculated the area under the curve to determine the cut-off value for evaluating the inspection accuracy of the BDG assay.
