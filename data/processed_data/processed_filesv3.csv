Citation - 9,"Based on the 1989 U.S. National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), 3% of men and women age 18-44 years who reported having diabetes also reported having ischemic heart disease. This increased to 14% of those age 45-64 years and 20% of those age ≥65 years. The most common cause of death in adults with diabetes is coronary heart disease. The only national incidence data for the United States come from a 9-year follow-up of the 1971-75 First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I), in which the age-adjusted death rate per 1,000 person-years was 28.4 for diabetic men and 10.2 for nondiabetic men age 40-77 years at baseline, and 10.5 and 4.1 for diabetic and nondiabetic women, respectively. The excess risk of heart disease occurs with both insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). In contrast to people without diabetes, heart disease in diabetic individuals appears earlier in life, affects women almost as often as men, and is more often fatal. As presented in Chapter 7, adults with diabetes are more likely than those without diabetes to have hypertension and dyslipidemia (low levels of high-density lipoprotein, HDL, and high levels of triglycerides and small dense low-density lipoprotein, LDL), but some of the increased risk of heart disease associated with diabetes appears to be independent of these factors. Insulin and glucose may act as cardiovascular disease risk factors, but data are inconsistent. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) found that improved control of blood glucose levels in young adults with IDDM reduced their risk of renal and retinal complications and may have also reduced their excess risk of heart disease. In contrast, preliminary results from the Feasibility Trial of the VA Cooperative Study on Glycemic Control and Complications in Type II Diabetes found an increased risk of cardiovascular events in insulin-treated patients with NIDDM. Further studies are needed to determine the role of insulin in the risk of cardiovascular disease. discussing the transfer of cocaine with members of the National Liberation Army [ELN] in Columbia.

Citation -233 ,"FUNDAMENTAL MECHANISMS OF REGULATED CELL DEATH AND IMPLICATIONS FOR HEART DISEASE We review in detail the basic biology of nine including death receptor-mediated apoptosis, death receptormediated necrosis (necroptosis), mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis, mitochondrial-mediated necrosis, autophagy-dependent cell death, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, parthanatos, and immunogenic cell death. This is followed by a dissection of the roles of these cell death programs in the major cardiac syndromes: myocardial infarction and heart failure. The most important conclusion relevant to heart disease is that regulated forms of cardiomyocyte death play important roles in both myocardial infarction with reperfusion (ischemia/reperfusion) and heart failure. While a role for apoptosis in ischemia/reperfusion cannot be excluded, regulated forms of necrosis, through both death receptor and mitochondrial pathways, are critical. Ferroptosis and parthanatos are also likely important in ischemia/reperfusion, although it is unclear if these entities are functioning as independent death programs or as amplification mechanisms for necrotic cell death. Pyroptosis may also contribute to ischemia/reperfusion injury, but potentially through effects in non-cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocyte loss through apoptosis and necrosis is also an important component in the pathogenesis of heart failure and is mediated by both death receptor and mitochondrial signaling. Roles for immunogenic cell death in cardiac disease remain to be defined but merit study in this era of immune checkpoint cancer therapy. Biology-based approaches to inhibit cell death in the various cardiac syndromes are also discussed. commercial value of $250.00..

South Asian people living in the UK have a higher rate of heart disease and non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Research into health knowledge and beliefs around these diseases is lacking. Accessing South Asian communities is difficult and is a barrier to research. We have undertaken a cross-sectional survey of South Asian people living in South Tyneside (UK) in 1996 based on a snowball sample to assess understanding of heart disease and diabetes. 334 South Asian men and women aged 16–74 y were interviewed. For heart disease, 115 (35%) people said they did not understand the meaning of the term, 62 (19%) were unable to provide any description, 48 (14%) could not give a single cause, and 54 (17%) could not suggest a preventive measure. For diabetes, 92 (28%) people did not understand the term, 43 (13%) could not provide any description, 75 (22%) were unable to suggest any risk factor and 64 (20%) could not give a preventive measure. For both heart disease and diabetes, two-thirds of respondents said they did not understand enough about the conditions to prevent them. There were important differences by sex and country of origin on the level of understanding with women and Bangladeshi people having lower levels of knowledge.

Subjects of South Asian origin ate significantly fewer meals per day than European subjects. Evening meal times were 2-3 h later among South Asians. Europeans ate less fruit but more vegetables and more brown rice than South Asians. Gujeratis ate more rice, fried snacks and white flour.

Anthropological analysis accepts that there are three levels of cultural behaviour: what people say they do (for example, during an interview), what they are actually observed to do, and the underlying belief system which drives that behaviour (Hall’s “primary level culture”6). In addition, consideration must be given to the wider context in which the behaviour takes place.

The serum beta-D-glucan (BDG) assay is used as an adjunct to the diagnosis of PCP; however, the cut-off value for this assay is not well-defined, especially in the non-HIV PCP population. Therefore, we aimed to identify the assay cut-off value for this population. In this retrospective observational study, we reviewed the medical records of all patients (≥ 18 years old) with clinical suspicion of PCP who underwent evaluation of respiratory tract specimens between December 2008 and June 2014 at Kameda Medical Center. We created a receiver operating characteristic curve and calculated the area under the curve to determine the cut-off value for evaluating the inspection accuracy of the BDG assay, 2003..

However making valid comparisons between studies was challenging due to a lack of standardized PA measurement.
